flathud is a Team Fortress 2 HUD modification made by flatline (that's me!).  The original development started around September of 2013.  Its design aims to present the most amount of information in the least amount of space as well as reimagine the style of TF2's graphical design.



##### Version: 3.1
##### Released: March 25th, 2016



#### Changelog:
* Fully updated for Matchmaking (at time of this writing) 
* Added watch streams button 
* Created uniform styling for main menu context buttons (contracts, streams, alerts, motd) 
* Tons of bugfixes 
* Deleted files relating to a now-unsupported hud management program 


#### FAQ:


**Q:** How do I install this?

**A:** Download the flathud master folder and pick your color version, Blue or Red.  Drag that respective folder
into your tf/custom folder and you're good to go.


**Q:** I have [x] bug.  How do I report this?

**A:** Report it to me through the [tftv thread](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/14664-flathud) or on the [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/flathud).  I might add you if we have to talk through something (do NOT add me for these things).


**Q:** My fonts are weird/don't show up.  What do I have to do?

**A:** Sometimes the fonts mess up for whatever reason.  If your fonts aren't displaying correctly, navigate to your flathud/resource folder and install
the fonts "big_noodle_titling" and all the ones beginning with "weblysleek" and test.  If they still are messed up, post on the thread or the group.

**NOTE: Mac and Linux users often have font problems, these are unfixable**


**Q:** How do I use the "favorite server" button?

**A:** First, obtain the IP of whatever server you want.  Next, go to resource/gamemenu.res and find the "FavoriteServer"
entry.  Then, paste your IP after the "connect" portion in the "command" section (make sure to leave a space).

`Example:  "command"  "engine connect 162.248.92.11:27015"`


**Q:** How do I use Fog's Xhairs?

**A:** The crosshairs are already installed in the hud.  Inside hudlayout.res, there is a value called "FogCrosshair".
The first thing we'll need to change is the "visible" value; change it to 1.  Next, using the crosshairs.png
inside your flathud folder, change the labeltext value to whatever value is on the graphic (ex. the plain
circle would be "7").  Finally, the "fgcolor" controls what color your crosshair is.  It uses rgba values
(google it).  If your crosshair is off center (after you save the file and hud_reloadscheme in console), mess
with the xpos and ypos until it looks right for you.

**Thanks for using flatHUD!**
